 /* We ask to read a sentence, which ends with a point, character  by character and to determine: */

//The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
// The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
//The number of vowels in the sentence.

//Instructions
//Each character will be treated separately.
//The last character is the.
// Use three variables as counters.
